        <p className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateTitle"]}>The Dip</p>

        <p className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>The Dip exercise is a compound bodyweight exercise that primarily targets the muscles of the upper body, including the chest, shoulders, and triceps, while also engaging the muscles of the core and lower body to provide stability.
         It's a highly effective exercise for building upper body strength and muscle mass. Incorporating dips into your workout routine can provide these advantages, leading to improved upper body strength, muscle development, and functional fitness. It's important to use proper form, gradually increase repetitions or difficulty as you progress, and avoid any movements or positions that cause discomfort or strain. </p>

         <p className={DipStyle["excerciseSecondTitle"]}> Technique:</p>

         <p className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Starting Position: Begin by gripping the parallel bars with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your arms fully extended. Keep your elbows locked and your shoulders stabilized. </p>

         <p className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Engage Core: Engage your core muscles by gently drawing your belly button towards your spine. This helps stabilize your torso throughout the exercise.</p>

         <p className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Lowering Phase: Inhale as you slowly lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping them pointed slightly behind you rather than out to the sides. Lower yourself until your upper arms are parallel to the ground or your elbows reach a 90-degree angle. </p>

         <p className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Pressing Phase: Exhale as you press yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms and pushing through your palms. Keep your shoulders stabilized and avoid locking your elbows at the top. </p>

         <p className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Repeat: Complete the desired number of repetitions, typically starting with 8-12 reps and gradually increasing as you get stronger.</p>



         <p className={DipStyle["excerciseSecondTitle"]}>Advantages:</p>

          <p  className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Upper Body Strength: The Dip exercise primarily targets the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and triceps, which are responsible for pushing movements.</p>

          <p  className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Triceps Emphasis: Dips place a significant emphasis on the triceps muscles, which are located on the back of the upper arm. </p>

          <p  className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Shoulder Stability: Performing dips requires shoulder stability and mobility, as the shoulders are involved in stabilizing the movement. </p>

          <p  className={DipStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Core Engagement: Engaging the core muscles during dips helps stabilize the torso and maintain proper posture throughout the exercise.</p>
