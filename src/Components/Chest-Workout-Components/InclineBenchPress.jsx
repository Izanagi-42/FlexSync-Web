        <p className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateTitle"]}>Incline Bench Press</p>

        <p className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>The Incline Bench Press is a variation of the traditional bench press exercise that primarily targets the muscles of the upper chest (pectoralis major), shoulders (anterior deltoids), and triceps. It's performed on an inclined bench, which means the bench is angled upwards at an incline, typically between 15 to 45 degrees. This variation places more emphasis on the upper chest and shoulders compared to the flat bench press.  </p>
         <br />
         <p className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseSecondTitle"]}> Technique:</p>

         <p className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Grip: Grasp the barbell or dumbbells with an overhand grip (palms facing away from you) slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. If using a barbell, lift it from the rack and hold it directly above your chest with your arms fully extended.</p>

         <p className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Engage Core: Engage your core muscles by gently drawing your belly button towards your spine. This helps stabilize your torso throughout the exercise.</p>

         <p className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Lowering Phase: Inhale as you slowly lower the barbell or dumbbells towards your upper chest, keeping your elbows close to your body and your upper arms at a 45-degree angle to your torso.  </p>

         <p className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Pressing Phase: Exhale as you press the barbell or dumbbells back up to the starting position, extending your arms fully and pushing through your palms. Keep your wrists straight and maintain control as you press the weights upward. </p>

         <p className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Repeat: Complete the desired number of repetitions, typically starting with 8-12 reps and gradually increasing as you get stronger.</p>
         <p className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseSecondTitle"]}>Advantages:</p>

          <p  className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Upper Chest Emphasis: The Incline Bench Press targets the upper portion of the chest more than the traditional flat bench press. </p>

          <p  className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Shoulder Activation: In addition to targeting the upper chest, the Incline Bench Press also engages the shoulders (anterior deltoids) to a greater extent compared to the flat bench press. This can help improve overall shoulder strength and development. </p>

          <p  className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Variety: Adding incline bench presses to your workout routine provides variety and helps target different areas of the chest and shoulders compared to flat bench presses.</p>

          <p  className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}>Functional Strength: Strengthening the upper chest and shoulders through incline bench presses can improve functional strength for activities that involve pushing movements at an incline, such as pushing objects overhead or performing incline movements in sports.</p>

          <p  className={InclineBenchPressStyle["excerciseTemplateExplination"]}> Stability: Performing incline bench presses on an incline bench requires greater stability and control compared to flat bench presses, as the inclined position challenges the stabilizing muscles of the shoulders and core.</p>
